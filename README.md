# JaroshJS-l10n

Internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) of JavaScript applications
may seem easy enough when you think of it from English language perspective.
You may think there's nothing easier then taking lexems off of your either HTML
or JS code and place them in a separate file as an associative array under
shortened keys... unless you face other languages, those with half a dozed of
noun cases, conjugation of adjectives  depending on number of associated noun
etc. etc. etc.
